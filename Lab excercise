üß™EXPERIMENT NO: 1

üí°Aim:

To download and install Hadoop 3.4.1 on Windows, understand its different modes (Standalone, Pseudo-Distributed), startup scripts, and configuration files.


---

üñ•Ô∏èSystem Requirements:

Windows 10/11 (64-bit)

Java JDK 11+

Hadoop 3.4.1 (Binary)

WinRAR/7-Zip (for extraction)

Git Bash or Command Prompt



---

üîßSoftware Installation & Setup Steps:

‚úÖ 1. Install Java

Download Java JDK 11 or newer:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html

Install and set environment variable:

JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.x.x

Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to Path



Check in Command Prompt:

java -version


---

‚úÖ 2. Download and Extract Hadoop 3.4.1

Download: https://downloads.apache.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.4.1/

Extract to C:\hadoop



---

‚úÖ 3. Install Winutils.exe

Hadoop needs winutils.exe for Windows. Download from: https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils

Place winutils.exe in:

C:\hadoop\bin



---

‚úÖ 4. Set Environment Variables

Go to System Properties ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Environment Variables, and add:

Variable	Value

HADOOP_HOME	C:\hadoop
JAVA_HOME	C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.x.x
Add to Path	%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%HADOOP_HOME%\bin



---

‚úÖ 5. Configure Hadoop Files

Navigate to:
C:\hadoop\etc\hadoop

Edit hadoop-env.cmd

Set:

set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.x.x

Edit core-site.xml

<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
    <value>hdfs://localhost:9000</value>
  </property>
</configuration>

Edit hdfs-site.xml

<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.replication</name>
    <value>1</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
    <value>file:///C:/hadoop_data/hdfs/namenode</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
    <value>file:///C:/hadoop_data/hdfs/datanode</value>
  </property>
</configuration>

Edit mapred-site.xml (first rename .template)

Rename:

copy mapred-site.xml.template mapred-site.xml

<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>mapreduce.framework.name</name>
    <value>yarn</value>
  </property>
</configuration>

Edit yarn-site.xml

<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>yarn.nodemanager.aux-services</name>
    <value>mapreduce_shuffle</value>
  </property>
</configuration>

‚öôÔ∏èRunning Hadoop

1. Format NameNode

hdfs namenode -format

2. Start Hadoop Daemons

start-dfs.cmd
start-yarn.cmd

3. Check Java Processes

jps

Expected output:

NameNode
DataNode
ResourceManager
NodeManager


---

üåêAccess Web Interfaces

NameNode: http://localhost:9870

ResourceManager: http://localhost:8088



---

üìùObservation:

Hadoop runs in pseudo-distributed mode on Windows.

Configuration files like core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, etc., are used to manage settings.



---

‚úÖResult:

Hadoop 3.4.1 was successfully installed and configured in Pseudo-Distributed Mode on Windows. Configuration files and startup scripts were edited and understood.


---

Let me know if you'd like the Experiment 2 (HDFS file operations on Windows CLI).


üß™EXPERIMENT NO: 2

üí°Aim:

To perform basic file management tasks in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) using command-line interface on Windows:

Add files and directories

Retrieve (read) files

Delete files and directories



---

üñ•Ô∏èPrerequisite:

Hadoop 3.4.1 already installed and running in Pseudo-Distributed Mode

HDFS services are started via:


start-dfs.cmd


---

üîßHDFS File Commands and Examples

‚úÖ 1. Create a Directory in HDFS

hdfs dfs -mkdir /user
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hadoopuser

Or combine:

hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/hadoopuser

üìù Creates a folder /user/hadoopuser in HDFS


---

‚úÖ 2. Put (Upload) a File into HDFS

Create a local sample file:

echo Hello Hadoop! > C:\sample.txt

Upload it:

hdfs dfs -put C:\sample.txt /user/hadoopuser/


---

‚úÖ 3. List Files in HDFS

hdfs dfs -ls /user/hadoopuser


---

‚úÖ 4. View File Contents

hdfs dfs -cat /user/hadoopuser/sample.txt


---

‚úÖ 5. Download File from HDFS to Local

hdfs dfs -get /user/hadoopuser/sample.txt C:\HDFSDownloads\

üìù Creates HDFSDownloads folder locally (create it manually if needed).


---

‚úÖ 6. Delete a File from HDFS

hdfs dfs -rm /user/hadoopuser/sample.txt


---

‚úÖ 7. Delete Directory from HDFS

hdfs dfs -rm -r /user/hadoopuser


---

üìùObservation:

Successfully performed upload, read, and delete operations using HDFS shell commands.

Understood the HDFS path structure and permission handling.



---

‚úÖResult:

Basic file management commands were executed successfully in HDFS using Hadoop 3.4.1 on Windows, validating the distributed file system's operational features.
